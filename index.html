                        <p>Ukraine is under seige. Over 3 million people mainly women and children have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded.
                            Men aged 18 - 60 are not allowed to leave the country of 44 million to beef up the country's military.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So far, this has the potential to be the worst humanitarian crisis in a long time.
                            <br/>
                            The invasion or special military operation as Pres. Putin called it, will be the most significant operation in decades in Europe and there are fears of millions being displaced.
                            We have witnessed first hand the destruction wrecked in Syria by Putin and the effects on civilians,children included.
                        </p>
                        <p>With your donations we will be supporting projects focused on kids in the Kyiv capital region.
                            This second most populated city in Ukraine has been facing shelling for several days despite the progress the military has made in repelling the forces.
                            Kids have been forced to take shelter in basements for days without food, water, or electricity, in freezing conditions.
                            Evacuations have been going on at a steady pace but much more can be done at a faster pace.
                            Each donation goes into vital care and services to those who are fleeing or still in the country. 
                            The services include emergency medical care, shelter, clothing, food, legal support, amongst others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are currently reaching out to our network to get urgent support to all the organisations stepping up to help those in need. It is typical to feel sorry in times like this, but we ask that you respond with love.
                            Please give what you can to this urgent appeal in the face of the evident cruelty and aggression. Please also make sure to share this fundraiser as widely as you can.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Putin's invasion of Ukraine is not only an attack on Ukraine. It is an attack on freedom, an attack on democracy, and a total disregard for a sovereign state and people. Putin's attack is a dire realization for the world and humanity at large.
